            <p>
              Storyline is an application to be used specifically in schools to
              sensitize students to toxic content distributed via the Internet.
              For this a playful concept was used, which is based on principle
              of storytelling and involves the students interactively in the
              stories.

        <h2>Conecept</h2>
        <p>
          The sensitizing takes place through interactive storytelling, where
          individual stories are told and the students can influence the further
          course. Stories are more memorable than sober facts. Active action in
          the strands contributes to this and leads to more conscious learning.

        <h2>Challenges and solution</h2>
        <p>
          There were two challenges during the conception of the application.
          The first was that a registration process should be considered in
          which the user logs in anonymously, but in later re-tests, data is
          assigned exactly to this user. The second challenge was that the
          design should be as neutral as possible and not too specific to age
          groups, as the age of the user groups varies widely.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first challenge, it was decided that the user should first
          select an avatar and then select exactly the same avatar again in the
          next test. In order to create a neutral design for different age
          groups, the focus was placed on a few colours. Mainly call to action
          buttons were given a bright color and the menu was equipped with
          theme-specific colors.

            explanatory manner.

            <h4>Login</h4>
            <p>
              The registration process has been reduced to a minimum so that the
              student does not have to provide any personal information. Only
              his avatar can be chosen. Tracing back to the student is therefore
              not possible.

            <h4>System errors</h4>
            <p>
              Two hints are displayed during the logon process. The first is
              when the avatar is selected, as it must be reused in later tests
              if the student is to remember it. The other notification is when a
              Student wishes to start the game early if he or she has not
              submitted all the information.

            <h4>Onboarding</h4>
            <p>
              Onboarding has only three explanations to the game. Below three
              points are displayed, giving the user an overview of the process.
              The user also has the option to leave the process prematurely via
              â€žSkipâ€œ. However, this has been positioned in such a way that it is
              not a faster-action option.

              The overview of the chapters is represented in a map form with a
              teaser text. A click opens the map and gives a deeper insight into
              the chapter.

              The chapter is presented in video form and then summarized by

              of the chapter with his selection.
