            <p>
              Nazzle is a playful application for children, which is experienced
              in nature. It is designed to lure children into nature through
              play. In doing so, they find themselves in a safe city park and
              can solve puzzles in it. Solving a puzzle is done with the
              interaction of the environment and the displayed objects on the
              smartphone screen. Augmented reality technology is used to combine
              both interaction elements.

            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <p>
              In the past, children always played outside and only played
              indoors when there was bad weather outside. Today, things look
              very different. Primarily, children stay indoors and sit in front
              of their game consoles.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class='flex flex-col mt-48'>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>
              We developed a mobile application in which the users have to solve
              puzzles in nature. We've used the technology augmented reality to
              make it more attractive for the kids. The technology allows users
              to solve puzzles on their smartphone displays which also interacts
              with the real enviroment. To do this, they see the puzzle on the
              smartphone screen used and can interact with elements of the game
              on it.

          <h3>User research</h3>
          <p>
            At the beginning we asked us: What are the characteristics of people
            who spend a lot of time playing smartphone or computer games?
            Therefore we have made a user research and after that some
            interviews with some kids of the target group. Also we looked at the
            market and how other games play with the technology augmented
            reality.

            After the user reasearch and some interviews we created Leon our
            Persona. This is Leon our Persona. He is 14 years old and played a
            lot of games. Leon is sporty and play soccer. Sometimes he prefer
            playing soccer on the console. He likes the connection with his
            friends when they are playing fifa.

          <h3>Market analysis</h3>
          <p>
            The market analysis shows that many applications make good use of
            the technology. Nevertheless, the analysis showed that the virtual
            objects displayed often had no direct connection to the context. It
            was therefore important to ensure that the virtual objects were
            significantly integrated into the game.

          <h3>Concept</h3>
          <p class=''>
            Using the information from the research process, a game for
            smartphones was developed in which the user tries to solve puzzles
            of any kind with virtual objects outdoors. The integrated technology
            Augmented Reality in combination with the game concept creates an
            immersive and unique gaming experience. In doing so, I paid special
            attention to the integration of the virtual objects in the game,
            where they are an essential part of the puzzle. In addition, the
            puzzles encourage an imaginative, creative and solution-oriented way
            of thinking.

            <h3>Sketches</h3>
            <p>
              To quickly capture initial ideas regarding the concept of the
              application, I drew them down on paper. After that, we went
              through two rounds of discussion as a team and discussed them. The
              result was that the presentation with a cartoon-like character
              could be most suitable for the children to develop a trustworthy
              and friendly basis. The rough draft of the interaction concept
              proved intuitive for us as a team and was further developed later
              on. Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            In order to capture as many interaction points of the user as
            possible, I developed a user flow of the application as a basis. It
            was important to me that the flow is intuitive and has no dead end.

            The wireframes also served as preliminary work for the final

            suitable for children and to check the logic of the application.

            <h4>Name definition</h4>
            <p>
              In fact, the name of the application came to us very quickly. It
              is a combination of the word "nature" and "puzzle". This is to
              reflect the aspect that this is an outdoor game and it's about
              solving puzzles.

            <h4>Choosing colors</h4>
            <p>
              Due to the fact that the application is primarily played by
              children, we decided to use slightly eye-catching colors.

              Renogare is an elegant geometric font that reflects the use of
              technological innovation. The straight and rounded shape of the
              letters ensures high legibility on the smartphone display even on
              sunny days.

            <p>
              From the beginning, a spherical fantasy figure accompanies the

              by entering a name. The figure is used to help the player get
              started and to assist in navigation or even within a puzzle.

              certain areas. For this purpose, permission to use the GPS sensor

              A navigation system is integrated into the game, which guides the

              During the development of the concept it became clear that it is
              important to protect the players and not to offer them the
              possibility to play in dangerous places.
